# Memory Game Project

### Description of the game:
The Memory Game is just a simple game of concentration. Users are able to flip over two cards at a time in an attempt to get two matching cards. The game is won when all the cards are matched. The goal is to match all the cards in the least amount of time, with the most amount of stars.

### Instructions for playing:
Download the files and open the .html file in any browser.

### Technical notes:
The game was built using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. A 'stopwatch' type function was used to keep track of how long it takes to match all the cards. There is also a score panel that lets the user know how they are doing as they're playing (star rating drops after a certain number of moves). When all the cards are matched, the game displays the winner stats: number of moves, game time, and star rating.
